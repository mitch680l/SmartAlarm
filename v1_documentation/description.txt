Smart Clock is a ardunio nano project.

It has all the normal features of a digital alarm clock.
*Change Alarm Time
*Change Current Time
*Displays Time on a 7 segment display

The "Smart" features of the alarm clock are the following.

*Instead of waking up to a loud noise, you will be genetly woken with a bright light
*Instead of there being a "set" time for an alarm(lets say 7 a.m. for example). 
You will be woken up within a hour timeframe, and the exact alarm time will be based on when you are in a light sleep state, inbetween sleep cycles.
This is what researchers have suggested is the optimal time to wake up.



Features to add or update.
*This is intended to be a real time system(RTS), since it can be used without internet connection. 
The RTS capability is relativly acceptable for an alarm clock, however testing has shown that over a few days, it will be a minute off the actual time.

*A back-up alarm that uses noise. Sometimes the light alone was not enough to wake me up, so a back-up alarm noise should be added to prevent waking up late

*Move onto a PCB
